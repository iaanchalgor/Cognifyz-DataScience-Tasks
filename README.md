📊 Data Science Internship Project — Cognifyz Technologies

 🎯 Overview
This repository contains my work completed during the Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies.  
The internship focused on real-world data analysis and predictive modeling, following structured levels and tasks designed to build practical data science skills.



🧠 Internship Tasks Overview
🔹 Level 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Explored dataset structure (rows, columns, data types)
- Handled missing values and performed data cleaning
- Analyzed distribution of the target variable (“Aggregate rating”)

🔹 Level 2: Descriptive and Price Analysis
- Analyzed categorical variables like Country, City, and Cuisines
- Identified top cuisines and cities with the most restaurants
- Examined online delivery and table booking availability
- Found most common price ranges and their impact on ratings

 🔹 Level 3: Feature Engineering & Predictive Modeling
- Extracted new features such as name length and address length
- Encoded categorical variables for ML readiness
- Built regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Optimized models using GridSearchCV
- Evaluated using R² Score and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)



 📊 Model Results
| Model | R² Score | RMSE |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Linear Regression | 0.23 | 1.32 |
| Decision Tree | 0.26 | 1.30 |
| Random Forest | 0.26 | 1.30 |



🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn,Plotly
- Scikit-learn



💡 Key Insights
- Most restaurants belong to lower price ranges
- Cuisines like North Indian and Italian received higher votes and ratings
- Online delivery is more common among budget-friendly restaurants
- Location and cuisine type moderately influence customer ratings



🧩 Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of the data science workflow
- Experience in EDA, visualization, feature engineering, and ML modeling
- Gained confidence in applying supervised learning techniques and interpreting results
